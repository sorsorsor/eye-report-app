About
=====

Eye Report is a UNESCO pilot project aimed at raising awareness and contributing to ending gender based violence. It is currently being implemented in China and Mongolia.

Advocacy: It is intended to be a platform for providing youth aged 15 to 24 years with basic information on gender based violence; how to prevent and to respond it.

User-generated content: The website and its related Application also allows for community assisted reporting of incidences of gender based violence, as well as the approximate location of the incidence on a user-generated map.

Anonymity and privacy: All information submitted by users with respect to incidences of violence (“ Take Action”) is anonymous. Users have the option of deciding to whom their contact information is communicated (police, shelter hotline, or friend), including GPS location, when using the “Need Help” feature on both the Application and website. Users’ contact details are not required and used, and all smartphones and computer identity information, metadata and digital footprints are neither stored nor communicated.

Information usage: All information provided under the “ Take Action” feature is used in populating the map (see Home Page), while under the “ Need Help” users have the option to independently decide whether or not to alert the police, shelter, hotline or a friend.

This pilot project is developed in collaboration with specialized partners working to end gender based violence, and with technical support from YiDe. It is based on UNESCO’s adherence to promoting Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), Open Access (OA) and Open Educational Resources (OER), which means that it would eventually be available to all, free of charge, for replication and adaptation to your community needs.
